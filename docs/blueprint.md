- Background color: Dark gray (#2A2A2A) for a modern, immersive viewing experience.
- Accent color: Bright white (#FFFFFF) for high contrast and clear readability.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and highly readable experience.
- Use minimalist, sharp icons to represent different functionalities and data points. These should be high-contrast and easily recognizable, even on small screens.
- Mobile-first, grid-based layout that adapts seamlessly across devices. Prioritize key content with a clear visual hierarchy and minimal clutter. Use expandable sections and collapsible elements on mobile to conserve screen space.
- Subtle animations for state changes and data updates, like smooth transitions for the driver standings and loading indicators for live data. Avoid excessive animations that could detract from the viewing experience.
